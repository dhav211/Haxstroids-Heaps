1. Create a gitignore so this file is never added.
-DONE-2. Entity shouldn't extend Bitmap. Ideally it shouldn't extend anything, but lets have it extend Object.
-DONE-3. Create a laser, which extends entity. In its constructor it will need a rotation, which is that of the space ship.
-DONE-4. In lasers update function it will move forward at a constant speed until it is outside of screen limits, then it will be destroyed.
-DONE-5. Create an asteroid class which extends Entity.
-DONE-6. Collisions, figure out differ so the spaceship can collide with an astroid. Then have laser collide with asteroid
-DONE-7. Have asteroid move.
-DONE-8. Spawn asteroid out side of screen limits, it will then move into the screen, when it leaves screen limits, have it warp like the spaceship.
-DONE-9. Create a small asteroid.
-DONE-10. When big asteroid is hit it will turn into 3 small asteroids. When the small asteroid is hit it will be destroyed.
11. Display points in top right of screen. 10 points for big asteroid, 15 for small.
